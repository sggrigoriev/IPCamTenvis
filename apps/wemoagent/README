Radio Thermostat of America - Example Application
==================================================

This is an agent that manages belkin WEMO
through the People Power cloud.  We can discover, measure, control, and 
synchronize the time on many WEMO on the local network.


To run it, first compile and run the proxyserver.  That proxyserver application
forms the connection with the server, and runs in its own window.  Your 
proxyserver will need to be activated to your user account on 
http://developer.peoplepowerco.com.  You can activate it with the command

  ./proxyserver -u username@email.com -p password
  
Or you can activate it through the cloud at 
  http://developer.peoplepowerco.com/docs/?q=account/activate
  
  (use device type 3 when activating - that tells the cloud it's the proxyserver
  application)
  
  
  
Then, compile and run the rtoaagent.  It will connect through a local socket to 
the proxyserver.  Make sure you have an WEMO WiFi connected to your
network, and the rtoaagent will do the rest of the work.  Once discovered,
the will automatically show up in your user account, because
the proxy which it is declared through should already be activated to your
account.

Once the agent is running, it uses the syslogs to capture information in the
background. Typically, the syslogs are captured in /var/log/messages, and can be
read with this command:

  tail -f /var/log/messages
