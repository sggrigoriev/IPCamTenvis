Release 1.0.4

gsrtsp_local    - Here are parts of gstreamer rtsp sources from plugins.
                  We got a little different task - make proxy client, so we need just small part of all code.
                  NB! Currently works on Ubuntu only.
                  Has to be ported to Hisilicon as well - it will reduce the huge Agent size!
